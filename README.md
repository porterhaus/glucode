# Glucode API

Capstone project started while mentoring at Bloc.io. I have been a Type I diabetic for 20 years. I am insulin dependent and currently use the Omni Pod pump system. My goal was to build a simple API that I can use to catalog my blood glucose logs, carbohydrate intake and insulin injections. I am building an app called METER that will utilize the API. I am currently exploring my first iteration of the app using the ionic framework.

The project is on-going and the goal is to build a core API that will implement more social interaction regarding how the data collected is consumed and managed. For this interation, everything is classified as 'SELF MONITORED'. In other words there are efforts like NIGHTSCOUT that utilize data inputs from 'CONTINUOUS MONITORING' solutions like the Dexcom meters. I have experimented with those however due to insurance constraints it is currently too expensive to maintain independently. Ideally, that would be the goal to have the data streaming real-time into the API. For now though, the API implementation remains simplistic in it's first interation. 

## Development

Implemented using the Ruby on Rails framework. Utilizes token-based authentication to maintain stateless communication. The documentation site can be found here: <http://porterhaus.github.io/glucode/>
